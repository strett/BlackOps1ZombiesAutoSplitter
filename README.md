I recommend 5and5's AutoSplit timer found here: https://github.com/5and5/LiveSplitAutoSplitterForBlackOpsZombies

Start, pause, reset and splits automatically.<br>

Working on all maps.<br>
Will split on Rounds: 2,20,30,40,50,70,100,110,120,130,140,150,163,170,180,190,200,210,220,230,240,250,260.<br>
Round: 2 to check the autosplit is working.<br>
Rounds: 20,30,40,50 splits are useful for first room players.<br>
Rounds: 30,50,70,100,...,163,...,260 for high round players.<br>
Rounds: 30,50,70,100 for speedrunners.<br>
